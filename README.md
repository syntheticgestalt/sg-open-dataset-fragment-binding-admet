1-a: Fragment affinity data for BRD4

\<Overview of Binding Affinity Evaluation\>  
Binding affinity refers to how strongly and stably a compound interacts with a target protein—in this case, BRD4. BRD4 (Bromodomain-Containing Protein 4\) is an epigenetic reader protein involved in transcriptional regulation and is known to play a role in various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory disorders.  
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a highly sensitive, label-free method capable of real-time detection of molecular interactions. It is particularly effective for the early screening of small-molecule fragments. In this study, we established an SPR assay targeting BRD4 and evaluated both binding activity and affinity for a total of 1,905 fragment compounds.

\<Experimental Method\>  
Fragment screening against BRD4 protein was conducted using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on a Biacore 8K (Cytiva) system, targeting 1,905 compounds from the High Fidelity Fragment Library (HFFL). BRD4 protein was immobilized on a Neutravidin (NA) sensor chip at approximately 3,000–3,400 RU. To reduce non-specific interactions, 50 µM amino-PEG11-biotin was injected across both active and reference flow cells for blocking. Each compound (100 mM in DMSO) was transferred to a 384-well SPR plate using an Echo 650 dispenser, with 0.5 µL per well. After adding 2.5% buffer, the final compound concentration was 500 µM with 3% DMSO. The screening was performed with a 30-second association phase and a 60-second dissociation phase. Blank buffer was injected every five cycles and the reference compound JQ1 (0.5 µM) every 25 cycles to ensure data consistency. Hit selection was based on parameters such as binding response, dissociation profile, residual binding at the end of dissociation, theoretical Rmax comparison, and similarity to the reference compound. A total of 78 compounds were identified as hits.

These 78 hit compounds were subjected to dose-response experiments using SPR to determine their binding affinities (Kd). Each compound was tested at three concentrations: 50 µM, 150 µM, and 500 µM. The compounds were dispensed into 384-well plates using an Echo 650 in volumes of 50, 150, or 500 nL, and DMSO was added to ensure a final volume of 500 nL with 3% DMSO concentration. Subsequently, 100 µL of 2.5% buffer was added using a MultiDrop Combi dispenser. Each measurement included two blank injections followed by a compound injection, with 30-second association and 60-second dissociation phases. Post-injection, a wash step using 50% DMSO was performed. Solvent correction was carried out at the beginning, middle, and end of the experiment using 2.5% and 3.8% DMSO buffers mixed in 8 different ratios. Binding affinities were determined from steady-state response versus concentration plots. Curve fitting was constrained by fixing the offset at 0 RU and setting Rmax based on the theoretical maximum for each compound. Compounds with Kd values below 1 mM were considered to show reliable affinities. Additional evaluation metrics included surface occupancy and assessment of steady-state behavior in the binding curves.

\<Data Analysis and Binary Classification\>  
Steady-state binding affinity (KD) was determined based on the SPR response plotted against compound concentration. To ensure reliable fitting with only three data points, the offset was fixed at 0 RU, and the theoretical Rmax was individually set per compound. Compounds with KD values below 1 mM were considered reliable, while those showing no plateau or linear binding responses were deemed less reliable.  
In addition to quantitative analysis, a binary classification was applied to the dataset. Specifically, fragments with KD values below 1 mM were labeled as positive (1), and those with KD values equal to or above 1 mM were labeled as negative (0).  
1-b:  Fragment affinity data for NRP1

\<Overview of Binding Affinity Evaluation\>  
Binding affinity refers to how strongly and stably a compound interacts with a target protein—in this case, NRP1. NRP1 (Neuropilin-1) is a cell surface co-receptor involved in various physiological functions including angiogenesis, neuronal guidance, and immune response.  
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a highly sensitive, label-free method capable of real-time detection of molecular interactions. It is particularly effective for the early screening of small-molecule fragments. In this study, we established an SPR assay targeting NRP1 and evaluated both binding activity and affinity for a total of 1,905 fragment compounds.

\<Experimental Method\>  
Fragment screening against NRP1 protein was performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on a Biacore 8K (Cytiva), targeting 1,905 compounds from the High Fidelity Fragment Library (HFFL). NRP1 protein was immobilized on a Neutravidin sensor chip at approximately 6,100–6,600 RU, and 50 µM amino-PEG11-biotin was used for blocking non-specific binding across both active and reference flow cells. Each compound, initially prepared at 100 mM in DMSO, was transferred to a 384-well plate using Echo 650 (0.5 µL/well), and diluted with 2.5% buffer to a final concentration of 500 µM and 3% DMSO. The reference compound EG01377 was prepared at 20 µM. The screening was conducted over four days in separate runs. Each injection involved a 30-second association phase without dissociation, followed by a wash with 50% DMSO. Blank buffer was injected every five cycles, and the reference compound every 25 cycles and at both the start and end of the experiment. Signal responses, slopes, residual binding, and comparisons to theoretical Rmax were used as criteria to select 192 hits.

Subsequently, dose-response measurements were performed for the 192 hit compounds to determine their binding affinities to NRP1. Each compound was tested at three concentrations: 50, 150, and 500 µM. Using Echo 650, 50–500 nL of each compound was dispensed into wells, followed by DMSO addition to adjust the volume to 500 nL and dilution with 100 µL of 2.5% buffer. Two blank injections were performed before each compound injection, which was conducted under 30-second association and 60-second dissociation conditions. The reference compound EG01377 was injected at the beginning, middle, and end of the experiment to monitor chip stability. Solvent correction was applied using mixtures of 2.5% and 3.8% DMSO buffers at multiple ratios. Kd values were calculated from steady-state responses using a constrained fitting approach: global fitting for offset and theoretical Rmax for each compound. Out of the 192 compounds tested, 146 exhibited reliable affinities with Kd \< 1 mM, while others showing linear responses or poor fitting were excluded from further analysis.

\<Data Analysis and Binary Classification\>  
Steady-state binding affinity (KD) was determined based on the SPR response plotted against compound concentration. To ensure reliable fitting with only three data points, the offset was fixed at 0 RU, and the theoretical Rmax was individually set per compound. Compounds with KD values below 1 mM were considered reliable, while those showing no plateau or linear binding responses were deemed less reliable.  
In addition to quantitative analysis, a binary classification was applied to the dataset. Specifically, fragments with KD values below 1 mM were labeled as positive (1), and those with KD values equal to or above 1 mM were labeled as negative (0).

1-c:  Fragment affinity data for SKP1

\<Overview of Binding Affinity Evaluation\>  
Binding affinity refers to how strongly and stably a compound interacts with a target protein—in this case, SKP1. SKP1 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 1\) is a component of the SCF (SKP1–Cullin–F-box) complex involved in the ubiquitin–proteasome system, and plays key roles in cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and cancer cell proliferation through protein degradation.  
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a highly sensitive, label-free method capable of real-time detection of molecular interactions. It is particularly effective for the early screening of small-molecule fragments. In this study, we established an SPR assay targeting SKP1 and evaluated both binding activity and affinity for a total of 1,905 fragment compounds.

\<Experimental Method\>  
Fragment screening against SKP1 protein was performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on a Biacore 8K (Cytiva) system. A total of 1,905 compounds from the High Fidelity Fragment Library (HFFL) were tested. SKP1 protein was diluted to 6 µg/mL and immobilized on a Neutravidin (NA) sensor chip at 2,500–2,900 RU via 1,000-second injection at 10 µL/min. To reduce non-specific interactions, 50 µM amino-PEG11-biotin was injected over all flow cells for 180 seconds. Each compound (100 mM in DMSO) was transferred to a 384-well plate using Echo 650 at 0.5 µL per well, and diluted with 2.5% buffer to a final concentration of 500 µM (3% DMSO). The reference compound Z0933M was prepared similarly at 100 µM. Blank buffer was injected every five cycles, and the reference compound every 25 cycles and at both the start and end of the experiment. Each compound injection involved a 30-second association phase and a 60-second dissociation phase, followed by a wash step using 50% DMSO. Solvent correction was performed at three time points using 8 different ratios of 2.5% and 3.8% DMSO buffers. Hits were identified based on response magnitude, dissociation behavior, residual binding, slope analysis, and comparison with theoretical Rmax values. A total of 98 compounds were selected as hits.

These 98 hits were subjected to a dose-response SPR study to evaluate their binding affinity to SKP1. Each compound was tested at 50, 150, and 500 µM. Dispensing was done using Echo 650 with DMSO adjustment to a 500 nL total volume, followed by addition of 100 µL of 2.5% buffer. Injections were performed with a 60-second association and a 120-second dissociation phase. Each compound measurement was preceded by two blank injections, and the reference compound Z0933M was injected at the beginning, middle, and end of the experiment to verify chip and protein stability. For Kd analysis, a global offset fit and theoretical Rmax values were applied to improve reliability given the limited data points. A total of 18 compounds showed reliable affinities with Kd \< 1 mM. Other compounds were excluded due to linear responses or atypical binding profiles, indicating unreliable or non-specific interactions.

Steady-state binding affinity (KD) was determined based on the SPR response plotted against compound concentration. To ensure reliable fitting with only three data points, the offset was fixed at 0 RU, and the theoretical Rmax was individually set per compound.

1-d:  Fragment affinity data for STING

\<Overview of Binding Affinity Evaluation\>  
Binding affinity refers to how strongly and stably a compound interacts with a target protein—in this case, STING. STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) is a cytosolic adaptor protein central to the DNA-sensing pathway, playing a pivotal role in initiating type I interferon-mediated immune responses in reaction to both exogenous and endogenous DNA.  
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a highly sensitive, label-free method capable of real-time detection of molecular interactions. It is particularly effective for the early screening of small-molecule fragments. In this study, we established an SPR assay targeting STING and evaluated both binding activity and affinity for a total of 1,905 fragment compounds.

\<Experimental Method\>  
Fragment screening against STING protein was conducted using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on a Biacore 8K (Cytiva). A total of 1,905 compounds from the High Fidelity Fragment Library (HFFL) were tested. STING protein was diluted to 100 µg/mL and immobilized on a Neutravidin (NA) chip at \~3,000 RU. To minimize non-specific interactions, 50 µM amino-PEG11-biotin was injected over both flow cells for 180 seconds. Each compound (100 mM in DMSO) was transferred to a 384-well SPR plate using Echo 650 at 0.5 µL per well, and 100 µL of 2.5% buffer was added to yield a final concentration of 500 µM with 3% DMSO. The reference compound CS\_3726 (SR-717) was prepared at 6 µM. During the screening, a 30-second association and 60-second dissociation phase were used. Blank buffer was injected every five cycles, and the reference compound every 25 cycles. Post-injection, a wash with 50% DMSO was performed. Solvent correction was conducted at the beginning, middle, and end of the run using eight different ratios of 2.2% and 3.5% DMSO buffers. Hit identification criteria included: normalized binding response \>30 RU, acceptable response slope, minimal stickiness (\<3 RU), no strong reference cell binding, and comparison to theoretical Rmax. A total of 75 hits were selected. Additionally, 54 compounds affected by irreversible binding of compound Z982117864 in Run 2 were directly included in the dose-response phase. In total, 129 compounds were advanced to dose-response evaluation.

Dose-response analysis was conducted at 50, 150, and 500 µM. Compounds were dispensed using Echo 650 (50–500 nL), DMSO-adjusted to 500 nL, followed by 100 µL of 2.5% buffer. Each compound was preceded by two blank injections, and the reference compound CS\_3726 (6 µM) was injected at the beginning, middle, and end of the run to confirm STING stability. Measurements used a 60-second association and 60-second dissociation phase. Affinity analysis used steady-state binding levels, with curve fitting constrained by global offset and theoretical Rmax. Of the 129 tested compounds, 39 exhibited reliable affinities (Kd \< 1 mM), while the remainder showed linear profiles or low surface occupancy, and were excluded from further interpretation.

\<Data Analysis and Binary Classification\>  
Steady-state binding affinity (KD) was determined based on the SPR response plotted against compound concentration. To ensure reliable fitting with only three data points, the offset was fixed at 0 RU, and the theoretical Rmax was individually set per compound. Compounds with KD values below 1 mM were considered reliable, while those showing no plateau or linear binding responses were deemed less reliable.  
In addition to quantitative analysis, a binary classification was applied to the dataset. Specifically, fragments with KD values below 1 mM were labeled as positive (1), and those with KD values equal to or above 1 mM were labeled as negative (0).  
2-a: ADMET data for BBB permeability  
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability refers to the capacity of a substance to cross the blood-brain barrier and access the brain.  
In this study, bidirectional permeability (apical-to-basolateral and basolateral-to-apical, Papp) of 50 compounds was assessed using MDR1-MDCKII cells to evaluate P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated transport. Cells were cultured for five days to form confluent monolayers, whose integrity was confirmed via transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Test compounds at 10 µM were added to transport buffer and incubated for 90 minutes at 37°C with shaking. Samples were then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. To determine whether compounds were P-gp substrates, co-incubation with the P-gp inhibitor cyclosporine A was conducted.  
This evaluation incorporated a correlation between in vitro Papp values and in vivo LogBB, defined as LogBB \= log₁₀(C\_brain / C\_blood). A LogBB ≥ \-1 was interpreted as indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, while LogBB \< \-1, which approximately corresponds to Papp (AB) \< 1×10⁻⁶ cm/s, was defined as low permeability. This criterion effectively excluded compounds with extremely poor membrane permeability.  
Furthermore, based on the calculated LogBB values, a binary classification was performed: compounds with LogBB ≥ \-1 were labeled positive (1) and those below that threshold were labeled negative (0). For classification purposes, only the Papp (AB) value was used, and efflux ratio or other parameters were not considered in the judgment.  
2-b: ADMET data for Microsomal stability  
Microsomal stability is a measure of the metabolic stability of a compound in vitro using liver microsomes, reflecting its susceptibility to enzymatic degradation.  
This study assessed the metabolic stability of 50 test compounds and several reference substances in pooled human liver microsomes. Microsomal incubations were carried out in 96-well plates, with five aliquots per compound corresponding to five time points (0, 7, 15, 25, and 40 minutes). The incubation medium consisted of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), MgCl₂, NADPH, glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and human liver microsomal protein (0.42 mg/mL).  
Test compounds (2 µM final concentration, 1.6% acetonitrile) were incubated at 37°C with shaking at 100 rpm. Reactions were quenched by adding acetonitrile containing an internal standard, followed by protein precipitation through centrifugation. The supernatants were analyzed using HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Based on the decrease in parent compound concentration over time, elimination constant (kel), half-life (t₁/₂), and intrinsic clearance (Clint) were calculated.  
Compounds with a half-life greater than 30 minutes were considered metabolically stable. Based on the results, a binary classification was conducted: compounds with t₁/₂ \> 30 minutes were labeled as positive (1), and those with t₁/₂ ≤ 30 minutes were labeled as negative (0).  
2-c: ADMET data for 3T3 phototoxicity  
Phototoxicity is an in vitro assay used to assess the potential of a substance to induce photoirritation, for example using 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells.  
In this study, an in vitro phototoxicity assay using NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cells was performed to evaluate the phototoxic potential of 50 chemical compounds. Each compound was tested at a single concentration of 20 µM, and cytotoxicity was assessed under two conditions: with and without ultraviolet A (UV-A) irradiation at an effective dose of 5.5 to 6 J/cm². Cell viability was determined using a resazurin-based fluorescence assay, and compounds that exhibited more than 40% difference in viability between irradiated and non-irradiated conditions were considered to have potential phototoxicity.  
Following the initial screening, six compounds that showed suspected phototoxic effects were selected for further evaluation through a dose-response phototoxicity assay. In this phase, the compounds were tested across a concentration range of 0.1 µM to 250 µM, and dose-dependent cytotoxicity was measured under both irradiated and non-irradiated conditions. From the resulting data, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) values were calculated, and the Photo-Irritation Factor (PIF) was determined. The PIF is defined as the ratio of the IC₅₀ value obtained under non-irradiated conditions to that obtained under irradiated conditions, expressed as PIF \= IC₅₀(−UV) / IC₅₀(+UV).  
Based on the PIF values, compounds were classified according to the following criteria: compounds with a PIF less than 2 were considered non-phototoxic; those with a PIF between 2 and less than 5 were considered to have possible or borderline phototoxicity; and those with a PIF of 5 or higher were classified as phototoxic. In addition, a binary classification was performed in which compounds with a PIF less than 2 were labeled as positive (1), and those with a PIF of 2 or higher were labeled as negative (0).
